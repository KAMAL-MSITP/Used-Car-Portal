                <h3>Will you purchase a financed car?</h3>
                <p>Of course! The first thing to do is get in touch with your financier and ask for a written request for the loan payout amount. We give you any remaining funds after paying the financier the entire outstanding balance. In the event that the payout exceeds your valuation, you will be responsible for the difference.</p>
