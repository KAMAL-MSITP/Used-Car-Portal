                <h3>1. Valuation: See what your car is worth to us.</h3>
                <p>Finding out how much we'll pay for your car only takes a few minutes.  We will send you a valuation by text and email once you enter your vehicle details.</p>

                <h3>2. Schedule an inspection, and we'll visit you.</h3>
                <p>We will travel to you, wherever you may be in Australia, to evaluate your car and verify the price we'll pay. You only need to enter your vehicle details to schedule an inspection.</p>

                <h3>3. Payment and Collection: We make our payments with cash.</h3>
                <p>An online sales agreement will be sent to you for signature. After everything is finished, an electronic funds transfer will be used to pay the deposit (EFT). When the car is picked up, the outstanding amount will be settled.  Every time, we'll pay you in full before regaining ownership of the vehicle.</p>

                <h3>Requirements for selling your vehicle</h3>
                <p>We are authorised motor dealers, so selling to us does not require a roadworthy certificate. You will be required to present both your driver's licence and the vehicle registration certificate at the point of sale. Please give us a call to discuss your options if you are unable to access these documents.</p>

                <h3>Have debts to pay off?</h3>
                <p>We'll purchase the financed car from you.
                    It's very easy to sell your car when you have a loan. First, get in touch with the company that arranged your loan and ask for a written estimate of the payout. Most will email you the current loan balance in less than a day.
                    
                    
                    We pay your financier the full amount owed and send you any remaining funds electronically fund transfer (EFT).
                    
                    At the time of sale, you will be required to pay the gap (difference) if the loan balance exceeds your valuation.
                    
                    Please be aware that before an inspection, we will need the VIN (vehicle identification number) or registration plate number for verification.
